    <h2>Just a burger...</h2>
    <p>Gordon made it. So must be good.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>5 ounces ground reindeer (venison works as well) </li>
        <li>3 ounces ground smoked reindeer (venison works as well)</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>Freshly cracked black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup chanterelle mushrooms, cleaned</li>
        <li>1 small yellow onion, sliced into Â½-inch rounds</li>
        <li>Unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 slices gouda cheese </li>
        <li>1 brioche bun, sliced and toasted on both sides</li>
        <li>Mayonnaise</li>
        <li>Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>Butter lettuce leaves</li>
        <li>Flaky salt</li>
        <li>1 large tomato, sliced   </li> 
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat for at least 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add ground meat to a bowl along with the egg and 1 teaspoon of olive oil, then season with salt and pepper before mixing together with your hands. Form the meat into a patty, not too thick. </li>
        <li>Add a couple of generous tablespoons of olive oil to the hot skillet, then place the reindeer patty on one side of the skillet. Add chanterelles to half the empty part of the skillet and season lightly with salt and pepper. </li>
        <li>Lay 3 of the onion rounds in the remaining empty space in the skillet, followed by 3-4 tablespoons of butter and let melt. Flip the burger once nicely browned underneath. Lay both slices of gouda on top of the burger. Flip the onion rounds once browned on the bottom.</li>
        <li>Once the mushrooms and onions are browned, transfer to a plate and cover the skillet with a lid to melt the cheese and finish cooking the burger. </li>
        <li>Assemble the burger by spreading about a tablespoon each of mayonnaise and mustard on the bottom bun, followed by a few leaves of lettuce. Top with a generous spoonful of the chanterelle mix, and follow with flaky salt and pepper before adding 1-2 slices of tomato.</li>
        <li>Remove the lid from the skillet and add a few more tablespoons of butter, and begin to baste the entire burger with the melted butter. Use a spatula to lift the patty out of the skillet and transfer on top of the tomatoes, followed by a few more grilled onion rings. Complete the burger by adding the top bun and serving immediately.</li>
    </ol>
