    <h2>What a jerk.</h2>
    <p>This is real feel-good carnival food. There’s nothing demanding about it, but the warmth of the spices punctuated by the fierce heat of the Scotch bonnet chillies always puts a smile on my face.This is real feel-good carnival food.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large chicken legs, skin on, cut into drumsticks and thighs and scored
        <li>Olive oil, for frying
        <li>2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>Rice, to serve</li>
        <li>4–5 thyme sprigs, to garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 220°C/Gas 7.</li>
        <li>First prepare the marinade by combining all the ingredients with a good grinding of black pepper and a dash of oil. Rub the marinade into the chicken pieces, massaging it into the scored meat. Leave to marinate for at least 1 hour (or, better still, overnight).</li>
        <li>Heat a large ovenproof pan over a medium-high heat and add a dash of oil. Fry the chicken pieces for about 10 minutes until golden brown on all sides. Add the Worcestershire sauce and cook for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cover with an ovenproof lid or foil and place in the preheated oven for 20 minutes until cooked through (if your pan isn’t ovenproof, simply transfer the chicken to a roasting tray). Remove the foil for the last 5 minutes if the chicken needs colouring a little more.</li>
        <li>Serve the chicken hot with rice.</li>
    </ol>
